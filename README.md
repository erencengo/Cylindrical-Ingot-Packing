Cylindrical Ingot Packing Simulation
Draft AI-assisted Python simulation of random packing of cylindrical ingots in a chamber. Includes top and side visualizations and drop-and-stick placement algorithm.
PROTOTYPE ONLY: Uses simplified cylindrical chamber model. NOT an accurate representation of actual production geometry.
Current Model ⚠️ 

Chamber: Perfect cylinder (50 mm radius, 130.8 mm height)
Ingots: Cylindrical (12.5 mm radius, 20 mm height)

Known Limitations

Conical bottom not modeled
Narrowing top opening not modeled
Height-dependent geometry not implemented
No 3D collision detection
Dimensions are approximations only


Future Development Needed:
- Conical bottom geometry
- Opening constraint validation
- Height-dependent radius function
- 3D visualization
- Monte Carlo analysis
- Physical prototype validation
